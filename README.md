# Climbing Point
Climbing Point is a climbing gym database for gyms located within the United States. These gyms are displayed on a map with pins indicating a gym location. Users are able to click on a pin to see more information about the gym including it's address, hours, type (bouldering/rope climbing), and more.

## Tech
This web application is built using the PERN tech stack. The UI is built with React with a backend consisting of Node.js and Express. The database used is PostGreSQL.

## Future Ideas
- Users are able to create an account which will allow them to pin their favorite gyms and easily navigate to those via a favorites list.
- Collect user location to have map on state they are located in on load (and if they are not sharing their location, then show entire United States?)
